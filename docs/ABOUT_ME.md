# About Me

I’m a career-changing software developer with a strong analytical background from the finance industry. I’m currently training as a full-stack developer, focusing on building reliable, well-structured systems and developing practical problem-solving skills through peer-reviewed projects.

My previous career as an investment analyst sharpened my ability to work with complex data, reason rigorously, and build tools that support decision-making. I’m now applying those same skills to software development, with a growing focus on backend systems, data handling, and clean interfaces between components.

I’m particularly interested in **fast-growing companies** where engineers have ownership and responsibility. While I enjoy working across the stack, I’m especially motivated to gain experience with **systems-level and embedded software** over time.

I’m actively seeking **junior software developer / software engineer roles** where I can grow in a professional engineering environment and contribute to production-quality code.
